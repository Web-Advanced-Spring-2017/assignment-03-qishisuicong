# Assignment 03

**Real Time Application**



## Assignment Specification
Develop a small project demonstrating real time communication between server and clients using websockets. It could be a data-visualization, a game, a bot, an IOT project etc. The list can go on and on. We've covered socket.io in class. Though you are free to use bare-bone web sockets or even firebase if you are feeling excited to try something new. Demonstrate the integration of database in your project. You may use mongodb as taught in class. Another alternative is Redis.*
